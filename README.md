LINK TO THE DEMO
http://bit.ly/10iAiqa

this demo allow you to authenticate based on face recognition. 
It use webRTC getUserMedia() for supported browser. 
For other it fallback to a file selection solution

It uses Skybiometry API that can be found and used easily from Mashape

I based some of this code on :
Raymond Camden
Miernicki

Disclaimer :
this is just a demo for fun, of course it is not a real authentification system, and a system based on face recognition raise many security issues
